hamforge's opinionated GitHub workflow for AI-assisted Laravel development, distributed as Laravel Boost skills.

It gives coding agents a consistent way to capture ideas, plan work, investigate and implement issues, and review releases without turning the package into a runtime GitHub integration.

Built and maintained independently by [hamforge](https://hamforge.dev) in Australia.

## What You Get

After installation, supported AI coding assistants gain access to the bundled GitHub workflow for capturing ideas, planning work, selecting and implementing issues, and reviewing release readiness.

## Installation

The package provides development-time workflow guidance rather than runtime application behavior, so install it in an existing Laravel Boost application as a development dependency:

```bash
composer require --dev hamforge/boost-github-workflow
```

Then ask Laravel Boost to discover the newly installed package and make its skills available to your configured AI coding assistants:

```bash
php artisan boost:update --discover
```

If Laravel Boost is not configured yet, install it and run its initial setup instead:

```bash
composer require laravel/boost --dev
php artisan boost:install
```

After the skills have been installed, normal `php artisan boost:update` runs keep the existing Boost resources current.

## Prerequisites

GitHub-interacting skills use [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) as their standard interface. Install `gh` and authenticate it before use:

```bash
gh auth login
```

## Conventions

By default, the package assumes the following workflow conventions:

- `priority:current` for the immediate working set
- `status:parking-lot` for unscheduled ideas
- milestones as the default representation of planned releases
- issues for planned work, pull requests for reviewed changes, and changelogs for shipped outcomes

Explicit project-specific workflow instructions may override these hamforge defaults.

## Skills
